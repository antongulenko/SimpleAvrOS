- Test features: analog input, motors, smooth motors
- Test precision: pwm min/max values, millisecond-timer, delay_XX()

== Refactorings/TODOs

- RPC-service for pin-occupations
- RPC-services for Tank-Driver

- Handle all interrupts with default (weak) routine
- Clean up simulation/ and mocks/

- Finish and test: processes, scheduler (also on AVR)
- Interrupt-handling concept for Processes/Scheduler
- Implement Mutex

== Tests TODO

- All Schedulers: idle, round robin, dms
- Remaining TWI AVR-driver states
- Finish Test-Scheduler, add tests for all modules not testable on Native
