- Test features: analog input, motors, smooth motors
- Test precision: pwm min/max values, delay_XX()

- io-time.sh script: compute milliseconds passed native and on device. Provide formula for device's real Frequency.
- Move io-* script library into TwiTool

== Refactorings/TODOs

- Handle all interrupts with default (weak) routine
- Finish and test: processes, scheduler (also on AVR)
- Interrupt-handling concept for Processes/Scheduler
- Implement Mutex
- RPC-service for pin-occupations

- Extend round robin: suspend processes

== Tests TODO

- All Schedulers: idle, round robin, dms
- Remaining TWI AVR-driver states
- Finish Test-Scheduler, add tests for all modules not testable on Native
