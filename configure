# This script creates a 'GNUmakefile' with almost the same functionality as the present 'Makefile'
# There are two differences:
#  - Variables passed from the command-line don't affect make anymore (like DEBUG= or SPEED=),
#		which means you have to choose the flags/options you need when calling this script
#  - The generated GNUmakefile is completely expanded and thus executes much much faster than Makefile

# Let make dump it's internal database with the passed parameters.
# This creates a big GNUmakefile (which is used by make prior to Makefile), filled with all targets and variables,
# already expanded. This GNUmakefile is executable by make and greatly speeds up the make-process!

# Dry-execute make once, to create all depended-on sub-Makefiles (.d).
# make reexecutes itself after that, which causes a double data-base being printed to GNUmakefile.
